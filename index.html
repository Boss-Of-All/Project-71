				<b>About The Festival</b>
			</h2>
			<h4><i>
					<p>The ancient Mavilakavu Temple is located at a distance of 5 miles from Kannur. A five-day festival held in the month of Medam (April-May) attracts many visitors because of the interest generated by the customs and rites associated with it. One particularly interesting feature is the Ati or Thallu performance where in there is a free exchange of blows between different parties who gather at paddy fields outside the temple for the purpose.</p>
					Legend goes like this; there was an Illam called Kacheri Illam where Chembakasserry Thamburan lived with his family in the place named Orika (present day it is called Kadamboor). There was a tradition of offering beaten rice (Avil) to the Vannathikandi thandan thamburan during Vishu. There was a fight for this packet of beaten rice between the two sons of Vannathikandi thandan thamburan . When the fight got serious and uncontrolable Thamburan prayed to their family god, Daivathar. The lord appeared before them and asked them to end their fight. After this incident, every year ‘Adiyutsavam’ is celebrated to commemorate this event.

				The five day annual festival has certain peculiar
features highlighted by the spirit of Kerala martial art
Kalaripayattu. From ancient times, north Kerala is wellknown as the cradle of martial arts, having given birth
to a galaxy of outstanding warriors as well as
exponents of the art. The festival of Mavilai kavu
recaptures part of the thrilling legacy.
The grand festival is conducted by devotees from all
parts of the Mavilai village. They assemble in the
temple courtyard in two groups. On a particular date,
there is an event named Thikkal in which two groups
stand in a row, facing each other, and pushes each
other by their shoulders, competing in physical strength
and technique. Thousands of onlookers watching this
daring test shout at their top of their voices in ear
splitting crescendo, encouraging the ‘pushing’
performers. On the next day this strange ritual
assumes wilder proportions, with the combat done,
each seated on a friend’s shoulders. As they fight
furiously the carriers strategically advance or retreat to
the fighter’s advantage. This event is known as Adi
Utsavam.
Besides the martial-art-oriented rituals, performances
of various types of theyyams also takes place. On the
next evening, the well-known mudi ceremony is held
wherein a devotee, after observing abstinence for
several days, dances wearing a huge head gear,
enthralling the audience.
